# README

This repo demonstrates important skills and code examples needed for the Web App Security Project in CPRG-312.

I've included helmet but haven't filled out any cache validation code as that's essential for the assignment.

The objective of this repo is to help you understand the code needed to built an application

## Branches Overview

- main: The main branch is designed for you to start editing in. Some of the code has been filled out but I removed parts that I think you'll get some benefit in working with
- main-spoilers: a completed version of the main branch
- react-setup: this is the same sort of thing but where we are serving the react app and our data from the api route to be read by the react app
